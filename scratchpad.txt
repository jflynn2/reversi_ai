Recurrent Neural Network trained using reinforcement learning - chances we are in optimal winning state in X moves?
Initially just use expected score next turn? 
Can cluster similar move types if we come up with features.

Neuroevolution to evolve architecture after that.

Train vs. self



General low-mid complexity game solving programme? Takes inputs and outputs best move?
